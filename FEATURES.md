**Example conversations:**
```
User: "This is too expensive for me"
AI: "I understand budget is important! This product normally sells for $100,
and it's already discounted to $85. For a valued customer like you,
I could offer an additional 10% off, bringing it to $76.50. How does that sound?"

User: "Can you do better?"
AI: "Let me check... I see you're a loyal customer with several past purchases.
I can authorize a 15% discount, making it $72.25. This is really the best
I can do while maintaining quality. Shall I generate a coupon code for you?"

User: "Deal!"
AI: "Excellent! Here's your exclusive code: DEAL-A7K3M9P2
This gives you 15% off and is valid for 7 days. Add it at checkout!"
